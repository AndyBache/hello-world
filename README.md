# hello-world
This is a training repository to get me familiar with GitHub.  Once I am up to speed I will start to create some development repositories.

So we have created a readme-edits branch in GitHub and this additional txt which will not be on the master branch is simply an example of adding changes to a branched line of code so that they can be worked on and committed to the branch prior to being merged back to the master version.
